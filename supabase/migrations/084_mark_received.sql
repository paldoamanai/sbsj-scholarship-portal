-- Disbursement is schedule, then mark received (run after 083).
--
--   * Marking a payment Disbursed (received) no longer needs an uploaded receipt or voucher: the office
--     marks it received, one at a time or in a batch. A cheque still needs its number, and MSWDO
--     payments still need the verified MOA (require_moa_before_release, 071).
--   * Everything else in guard_payments is unchanged (038): disbursed payments stay locked, payments
--     only for approved applications, the scholar's chosen method is fixed.
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor. Safe to re-run.
